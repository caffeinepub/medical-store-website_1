# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the pharmacy store information (name, phone, hours, and location) across the entire application.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the backend store info record to set name to "Sameer Medical", phone to "0000999988", hours to "Mon-Sun: 10:00 AM – 3:00 PM & 6:00 PM – 10:00 PM", and address to "Shahabad, Karnataka, India"
- Replace all occurrences of the previous pharmacy name with "Sameer Medical" in the Header, HeroSection, AboutUsSection, Footer, and any other components
- Update HeroSection, AboutUsSection, and Footer to display the new phone number, hours, and location (from backend query or updated fallback defaults)

**User-visible outcome:** Every part of the site consistently shows "Sameer Medical" as the store name, with the correct phone number, operating hours, and city/location displayed throughout.
